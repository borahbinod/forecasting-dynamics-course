The purpose of this exercise is to practice loading a time series then decomposing 
it and testing for temporal autocorrelation. You can adapt the code that we
went over in class:
[Time series decomposition code](https://github.com/pbadler/forecasting-dynamics-course/blob/master/lectures/decomp_tutorial.R)
[Autocorrelation code](https://github.com/pbadler/forecasting-dynamics-course/blob/master/lectures/autocorrelation.R)

The first step is to download the data...

Convert it to a time series object....

You should hand in 1) an R script containing all the code you wrote to do your 
analysis, and 2) a pdf/docx/odt file answering the following questions:

1) Is there a seasonal signal in the time series? Answer with a figure
and an explanation of that figure.

2) Is there a long-term trend in the time series? Answer with a figure
and an explanation of that figure.

3) Is there autocorrelation? At what lags (in months)?

4) Is there partial autocorrelation? At what lags?
