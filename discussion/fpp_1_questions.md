## What can we forecast?

* The reading suggests that three things influence our ability to forecast:
    * how well the factors driving the response are understood
	* how much data is available
	* whether the forecast influences the thing being forecast
    * Why do each of these matter?
* Are there examples in ecology where a forecast could influence the thing being
  forecast?
  
## Forecasting, planning, and goals

* What do we want short-term, medium-term, and long-term forecasts for in
  ecology?
    * What kinds of actual time-scales would these represent?
* How might these different "forecasting horizons" influence our approaches to
  forecasting?

## Determining what to forecast

* Important to find or collect right data
    * Do we have most of the data we need?
	* Do we act like it?
	* What are examples of additional data we should collect?
	    * Large scale or small scale collection?
            * Experiments or observations?
* Cross-sectional vs. time-series
    * What is a good example of cross-sectional forecasting in ecology?
    * What is a good example of time-series forecasting?
* Why might we use a time-series only model for forecasting?

## Case studies

* Do any of the case studies remind you of ecological patterns or questions?
* How complicated are the case studies compared to ecological problems?

## Basic steps

* What did you think of the basic steps?
* Let's talk through an example for an ecological question
* How well do you think our field does at each of these steps?
* What can we do to improve on our current approaches?
